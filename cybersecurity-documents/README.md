# Cybersecurity Documents

In the intricate domain of cybersecurity, understanding the diverse range of organisational documents is essential to ensure robust and consistent protection mechanisms. This guide illuminates the various cybersecurity-centric organisational documents, from the foundational Governance Documents that shape overarching security direction, to Procedures that detail specific protective steps. We'll delve into Architectural Principles that enforce secure system designs, Strategies that chart long-term cybersecurity goals, Policies that dictate security protocols, Standards that ensure uniformity in defenses, Guidelines offering best practices for threat mitigation, and Plans that layout response and preventive measures. Whether you're just stepping into the cybersecurity realm or are a seasoned expert, this breakdown serves as an invaluable guide to grasping the intricate interplay of documents that fortify an organisation's cyber defenses.

## **1. Document Hierarchy**
### 1.1. Governance Documents
- **Purpose**: Establish the overarching direction and framework for organizational operation, defining authority, roles, and responsibilities. Ensures alignment with the organization's mission, vision, and values.
- **Hierarchy**: Foundational for all other organizational documents. Other documents derive their authority and direction from governance documents.

### 1.2. Architectural Principles
- **Purpose**: Dictate the design and implementation rules for systems and solutions, ensuring consistency, interoperability, and alignment with organizational goals.
- **Hierarchy**: Derived from Governance Documents and provide direction for Strategies, Policies, Standards, and Procedures.

### 1.3. Strategies
- **Purpose**: Outline long-term organizational goals and the methods to achieve them. Direct decision-making and resource allocation towards the mission and objectives.
- **Hierarchy**: Developed based on Governance Documents and Architectural Principles. They guide the creation of Policies, Plans, and Procedures.

### 1.4. Policies
- **Purpose**: Provide high-level statements of management intent, dictating expected behaviors and actions within the organization.
- **Hierarchy**: Informed by Strategies and Governance Documents. Serve as a foundation for the creation of Standards and Procedures.

### 1.5. Standards
- **Purpose**: Offer specific details on how to meet policy requirements, ensuring consistency across the organization.
- **Hierarchy**: Derived from Policies. They guide the development of Procedures and are informed by Guidelines.

### 1.6. Procedures
- **Purpose**: Detail step-by-step instructions for implementing standards and executing specific tasks or activities.
- **Hierarchy**: Developed based on Standards, with reference to Guidelines, and operate within the framework set by Policies.

### 1.7. Guidelines
- **Purpose**: Provide non-mandatory best practices and suggestions to achieve desired outcomes.
- **Hierarchy**: Supportive of all other document types, offering additional clarity and guidance. Especially relevant for Standards and Procedures.

### 1.8. Plans
- **Purpose**: Lay out specific actions, timelines, and resource allocations to achieve a particular goal or objective.
- **Hierarchy**: Developed based on Strategies and Policies, guiding teams in implementing organizational projects.
