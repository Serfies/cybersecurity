# Cybersecurity Standard

## 1. Introduction
### 1.1. Purpose
The Cybersecurity Standard serves as a robust framework to systematically manage and mitigate the cybersecurity risks faced by the organisation. By aligning with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0, this standard adopts a tailored and risk-informed approach for improving security and resilience.

The core of this standard maps the NIST CSF 2.0 Functions and Categories to specific controls, facilitating a structured implementation of the CSF within the organisation. Each control outlined in this standard is traced back to one or more elements of the NIST CSF 2.0, ensuring comprehensive coverage of cybersecurity aspects including governance, risk management, protection mechanisms, detection capabilities, response protocols, and recovery plans.

This Cybersecurity Standard is an integral part of the organisation’s overall risk management strategy. It is underpinned by a suite of essential governance documents including policies, standards, procedures, plans, and guidelines, which are elaborated in the subsequent sections. These documents are meticulously mapped to the NIST CSF 2.0 to ensure a coherent and consistent approach towards achieving the cybersecurity objectives outlined by the NIST framework.

Furthermore, this Cybersecurity Standard promotes a culture of continuous improvement by encouraging regular reviews and updates in response to the evolving threat landscape and organisational changes. It also emphasizes the importance of training and awareness among all stakeholders to foster a security-centric culture.

The subsequent sections will provide a detailed mapping of the NIST CSF 2.0 Functions and Categories to the respective controls, policies, and other governance documents, delineating the organisational approach towards achieving a resilient and secure operational environment.

### 1.2. Scope
The scope of this Cybersecurity Standard encompasses the entirety of our organisation’s information systems, data, technologies, operations, and processes. It extends to all personnel, contractors, vendors, and other stakeholders who interact with or have access to our organisation's digital assets and resources.

The primary objective of this standard is to map the Functions and Categories of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 to specific controls that are vital for enhancing the cybersecurity posture of the organisation. These controls are divided into two distinct groups:

1. **MUST HAVE Controls:** These are fundamental controls deemed essential for safeguarding the organisation against prevalent cybersecurity threats and risks. They form the baseline security measures that are critical for compliance with regulatory requirements, and ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the organisation’s information assets.

2. **SHOULD HAVE Controls:** These are additional controls that, while not mandatory, are highly recommended to further strengthen cybersecurity defenses, promote best practices, and support the continuous improvement of our cybersecurity program.

This standard aims to provide a structured and systematic approach to implementing the NIST CSF 2.0, allowing for a clear understanding and communication of security requirements, roles, and responsibilities across the organization. By distinguishing between MUST HAVE and SHOULD HAVE controls, this standard facilitates a prioritised, risk-based approach to resource allocation and cybersecurity investments.

Furthermore, this Cybersecurity Standard is designed to be a living document, with provisions for regular reviews and updates to reflect the evolving cybersecurity landscape, technological advancements, and changes in organisational priorities and regulatory obligations.

Through the effective implementation and adherence to this standard, our organisation strives to achieve a resilient cybersecurity infrastructure capable of responding to and recovering from adverse cyber events, thereby ensuring the sustained achievement of business objectives and the protection of stakeholder interests.

## 2. Govern (GV)
The GOVERN Function lays the foundation for a well-structured cybersecurity framework within our organization. It delineates the strategic direction and establishes the governance model for managing cybersecurity risks, aligning them with the organizational objectives and regulatory requirements. This function is pivotal in ensuring a cohesive approach to cybersecurity across all organizational facets, setting the stage for how we prioritize and achieve the outcomes defined in the other five Functions of the NIST CSF 2.0.

Setting a clear strategic direction for cybersecurity is paramount. It involves defining the organization's cybersecurity vision, mission, and objectives in alignment with the overall business strategy. This strategic direction guides decision-making processes, resource allocation, and prioritization of cybersecurity initiatives.

The governance model outlines the framework within which cybersecurity decisions are made. It defines the roles, responsibilities, and authorities at various organizational levels, ensuring accountability and oversight in the management of cybersecurity risks.

### 2.1. Organizational Context Understanding
Understanding the organizational context is vital for effective cybersecurity governance. It involves analyzing the internal and external factors that can impact the organization's cybersecurity posture, including technological advancements, regulatory changes, and evolving threat landscapes.

### 2.2. Risk Management Strategy
A robust risk management strategy is at the core of our cybersecurity governance. It encompasses the identification, assessment, mitigation, and monitoring of cybersecurity risks. This strategy is crucial for making informed decisions and ensuring that cybersecurity controls are effectively aligned with the risk profile of the organization.

### 2.3. Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management
Managing risks in the cybersecurity supply chain are crucial aspects of the GOVERN Function. These elements ensure that cybersecurity considerations are integrated into procurement processes and relationships with vendors, partners, and other third parties.

### 2.4. Roles, Responsibilities, and Authorities
Defining the roles, responsibilities, and authorities for cybersecurity ensures clear accountability and fosters a culture of security within the organization. It also facilitates effective communication and coordination among different stakeholders involved in managing cybersecurity risks.

### 2.5. Policies, Processes, and Procedures
Formulating well-defined policies, processes, and procedures for cybersecurity provides a structured approach to managing cyber risks. These documents serve as a reference for the organization, ensuring consistency in the implementation of cybersecurity controls.

### 2.6. Oversight of Cybersecurity Strategy
Oversight is essential for ensuring that the cybersecurity strategy is effectively implemented and adhered to. It involves monitoring, reviewing, and updating the cybersecurity governance framework to ensure it remains relevant and effective in addressing the evolving cybersecurity challenges.
