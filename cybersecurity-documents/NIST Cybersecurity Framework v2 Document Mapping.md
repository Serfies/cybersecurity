# NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 Document Mapping

## 1. GOVERN
Set the strategic direction and governance model for cybersecurity. Establish and monitor organization risk management strategy, expectations, and policy.

The GOVERN Function is cross-cutting and provides 
outcomes to inform how an organization will achieve and prioritize the outcomes of the other five Functions in the context of its mission and stakeholder expectations. Governance activities are critical for incorporating cybersecurity into an organization’s broader enterprise risk management strategy. GOVERN directs an understanding of 
organizational context; the establishment of cybersecurity strategy and cybersecurity supply chain risk management; roles, responsibilities, and authorities; policies, processes,  and procedures; and the oversight of cybersecurity strategy.

## 2. IDENTIFY
Understand the organization's assets, vulnerabilities, and risks. Determine the current cybersecurity risk to the organization.

Understanding its assets (e.g., data, hardware, software, systems, facilities, services, people) and the related cybersecurity risks enables an organization to focus and prioritize its efforts in a manner consistent with its risk management strategy and the mission needs identified under GOVERN. This Function also includes the identification of improvements needed for the organization’s policies, processes, procedures, and practices supporting  cybersecurity risk management to inform efforts under all six Functions

## 3. PROTECT
Deploying appropriate safeguards to sufficiently mitigate and reduce cybersecurity risk.

Once assets and risks are identified and prioritized, PROTECT supports the ability to secure those assets to 
prevent or lower the likelihood and impact of adverse cybersecurity events. Outcomes covered by this Function include awareness and training; data security; identity 
management, authentication, and access control; platform security (i.e., securing the hardware, software, and services of physical and virtual platforms); and the resilience of technology infrastructure.

## 4. DETECT
Detect anomalies and incidents. Find and analyze possible cybersecurity attacks and compromises.

DETECT enables timely discovery and analysis of anomalies, indicators of compromise, and other potentially adverse cybersecurity events that may indicate that cybersecurity
attacks and incidents are occurring.

## 5. RESPOND
Take action regarding a detected cybersecurity incident.

RESPOND supports the ability to contain the impact of cybersecurity incidents. Outcomes within this Function cover incident management, analysis, mitigation, reporting, and 
communication.

## 6. RECOVER
Recovery actions after an incident, ensuring business continuity. Restore assets and operations that were impacted by a cybersecurity incident.

RECOVER supports timely restoration of normal operations to reduce the impact of cybersecurity incidents and enable appropriate communication during recovery efforts.

**Note:** This structure follows the NIST Cybersecurity Framework v2.0, separating items into categories of Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. All items are categorized illustratively, and organizations should modify the assignment based on specific internal processes and requirements. Links _(represented by `#`)_ can be added to each item for detailed documentation.
