# NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 Document Mapping

## Governance
All cybersecurity policies, standards, procedures, plans and guidelines in an organisation should be subject to the organisation's [Cybersecurity Strategy](#cybersecurity-strategy).

## Cybersecurity Standard
The [Cybersecurity Standard](#cybersecurity-standard) maps NIST CSF Functions and Categories to specific controls to implement the CSF in the organisation. The Cybersecurity Standard (also called the Information Security Management System) is supported by a set of important policies, standards, procedures, plans and guidelines mapped to the NIST CSF in the next section.

## Mapping table
The table below provides insight into the various supporting policies, standards, procedures, plans and guidelines required alongside the Cybersecurity Standard to fully implement the NIST CSF in an organisation.

## NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 Summarised

### 1. GOVERN
Set the strategic direction and governance model for cybersecurity. Establish and monitor organization risk management strategy, expectations, and policy.

The GOVERN Function is cross-cutting and provides 
outcomes to inform how an organization will achieve and prioritize the outcomes of the other five Functions in the context of its mission and stakeholder expectations. Governance activities are critical for incorporating cybersecurity into an organization’s broader enterprise risk management strategy. GOVERN directs an understanding of 
organizational context; the establishment of cybersecurity strategy and cybersecurity supply chain risk management; roles, responsibilities, and authorities; policies, processes,  and procedures; and the oversight of cybersecurity strategy. 

### 2. IDENTIFY
Understand the organization's assets, vulnerabilities, and risks. Determine the current cybersecurity risk to the organization.

Understanding its assets (e.g., data, hardware, software, systems, facilities, services, people) and the related cybersecurity risks enables an organization to focus and prioritize its efforts in a manner consistent with its risk management strategy and the mission needs identified under GOVERN. This Function also includes the identification of improvements needed for the organization’s policies, processes, procedures, and practices supporting  cybersecurity risk management to inform efforts under all six Functions.

### 3. PROTECT
Deploying appropriate safeguards to sufficiently mitigate and reduce cybersecurity risk.

Once assets and risks are identified and prioritized, PROTECT supports the ability to secure those assets to 
prevent or lower the likelihood and impact of adverse cybersecurity events. Outcomes covered by this Function include awareness and training; data security; identity 
management, authentication, and access control; platform security (i.e., securing the hardware, software, and services of physical and virtual platforms); and the resilience of technology infrastructure.

### 4. DETECT
Detect anomalies and incidents. Find and analyze possible cybersecurity attacks and compromises.

DETECT enables timely discovery and analysis of anomalies, indicators of compromise, and other potentially adverse cybersecurity events that may indicate that cybersecurity attacks and incidents are occurring. 

### 5. RESPOND
Take action regarding a detected cybersecurity incident.

RESPOND supports the ability to contain the impact of cybersecurity incidents. Outcomes within this Function cover incident management, analysis, mitigation, reporting, and communication.

### 6. RECOVER
Recovery actions after an incident, ensuring business continuity. Restore assets and operations that were impacted by a cybersecurity incident.

RECOVER supports timely restoration of normal operations to reduce the impact of cybersecurity incidents and enable appropriate communication during recovery efforts. 

## Documentation Overview
This section provides an overview of the various document discussed above. Links are provided to a curated set of document templates that can be used as starting point for quickly implementing the NIST CSF in an organisation.

### Cybersecurity Governance Document
A document that outlines the strategic direction, principles, and accountabilities for cyber security in your organization. This document should include a clear definition of the roles and responsibilities of the board of directors, executive management, chief information security officer (CISO), and other relevant stakeholders.

### Cybersecurity Strategy
A cyber security strategy is a crucial document as it aligns cyber security with the wider organizational objectives. It helps to address the relationship between business and cyber security outcomes, which depend on the same people, processes, and technology. The strategy is tailored to the organization’s specific context, including its operating environment. External factors such as regulatory or compliance considerations and internal factors such as insider threats or third-party dependencies can influence an organization’s approach to cyber security.

### Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management Procedure

### Cybersecurity Roles and Responsibilities

### Asset Management Policy
A document that outlines the principles and guidelines for managing an organization’s IT assets. It provides a framework for the appropriate and effective management of IT equipment (hardware and software) from procurement to disposal. The policy defines responsibilities that relate to the implementation of this policy and is designed to ensure that IT assets are accounted for, deployed, maintained, upgraded, and disposed of when the time comes. It also ensures that IT assets are managed appropriately in a way that is compliant with the organization’s policies and regulatory obligations.

### Asset Management Procedure
A procedure that ensures an organization's assets are accounted for, deployed, maintained, upgraded, and disposed of when the time comes. It is the process of tracking and managing an organization's IT assets to ensure that every asset is properly used, maintained, upgraded, and disposed of at the end of its lifecycle. The procedure includes creating a detailed inventory of all IT assets, calculating lifecycle costs for all assets in your inventory, tracking the assets throughout their lifecycle, and ensuring that software licensing is in full compliance. The IT asset management process creates a single source of truth when optimizing budgets, supporting lifecycle management, and making decisions that impact the entire organization. It is important to have an IT Asset Management Procedure in place to understand the total cost of ownership and optimize the use of assets.

### Vulnerability Management Procedure

### Continuous Improvement Policy
A document that outlines the organization’s approach to continuous improvement and provides guidance on how to identify, assess, and manage improvements.

**Note:** This structure follows the NIST Cybersecurity Framework v2.0, separating items into categories of Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. All items are categorized illustratively, and organizations should modify the assignment based on specific internal processes and requirements. Links _(represented by `#`)_ can be added to each item for detailed documentation.
