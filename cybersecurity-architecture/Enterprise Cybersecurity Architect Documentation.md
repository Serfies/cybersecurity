# **Enterprise Cybersecurity Architect Documentation**

An Enterprise Cybersecurity Architect plays a crucial role in protecting the organisation's data from various security threats. By setting up a strong cybersecurity framework, they help build a resilient business environment. This role not only involves creating and strictly enforcing policies, standards, and procedures, but also requires careful adherence to legal and regulatory rules. Acting as a bridge between the executive leadership and technical teams, they ensure that the cybersecurity strategy aligns well with the wider organisational goals, promoting a culture of security awareness and active protection.

Each document type in this hierarchy serves a distinctive purpose yet is integrally connected, creating a comprehensive and structured cybersecurity documentation architecture. This meticulous organisation facilitates clear communication, informed decision-making, and robust cybersecurity governance, thereby significantly enhancing the organisation's security posture and resilience against cyber threats.

Below is an explanation of the document types and their hierarchy in the context of cybersecurity architecture.

## 1. **Governance Documents**
   - **Purpose:** Governance documents applied to the domain of cybersecurity, serve to establish the frameworks, structures, roles, and processes that underpin the management and oversight of the organisation's cybersecurity program. They are crucial for ensuring that cybersecurity efforts are aligned with the organisation's objectives, legal and regulatory requirements, and best practices.
   - **Hierarchy:** Governance Documents encapsulate the entire hierarchy, establishing the frameworks for managing and overseeing the cybersecurity program.
   - **Document list:**
     - **Cybersecurity Governance Framework:** A structured approach to managing and overseeing an organisation's cybersecurity policies, procedures, and technologies, ensuring alignment with business objectives and regulatory requirements. It defines the roles, responsibilities, and processes necessary for effective cybersecurity risk management, fostering a culture of security and compliance across the organisation.
     - **Cybersecurity Roles and Responsibilities:** Delineates the specific duties, authorities, and expectations for individuals and teams within an organisation concerning cybersecurity tasks and decision-making. It aims to establish clarity, accountability, and coordination among various stakeholders in managing cybersecurity risks and implementing security measures, ensuring everyone is aligned in maintaining a secure and compliant operational environment.
     - **Cybersecurity Risk Management Framework:** A structured approach for identifying, assessing, and mitigating cybersecurity risks, ensuring that the organisation's digital assets and operations are adequately protected. The framework is typically a subset or a specialised extension of the company's general Risk Management Framework or Standard, designed to address the unique challenges and requirements associated with cybersecurity, while aligning with the broader risk management objectives and strategies of the organisation.
     - **Compliance Framework:** A structured perspective that helps an organisation adhere to legal, regulatory, and industry standards, ensuring that operations are conducted within the prescribed legal and ethical boundaries. In the realm of cybersecurity, this framework informs the architecture by outlining the necessary controls, processes, and technologies required to meet specific compliance standards, thereby aiding in the design and implementation of a cybersecurity infrastructure that satisfies both internal and external compliance obligations.

## 2. **Architectural Principles**
   - **Purpose:** These principles delineate the fundamental ethos and guidelines for the entire cybersecurity landscape within the organization. They serve as the North Star for all cybersecurity endeavors, underscoring the organization's commitment to safeguarding its digital assets.
   - **Hierarchy:** As the apex of the document hierarchy, principles undergird all other document types and dictate the overarching cybersecurity posture.
   - **Document list:**
     - **Enterprise Architecture Principles:** Fundamental guidelines that inform and steer the decision-making process within an organisation, ensuring that the enterprise architecture supports and enables the achievement of organisational objectives. They embody the values and practices essential for creating a coherent and consistent architectural framework across the business, IT, and technological landscapes.
     - **Cybersecurity Architectural Principles:** Foundational guidelines that drive the design and implementation of cybersecurity measures within an organisation, ensuring a robust and resilient security posture. They encapsulate core values such as confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience, guiding decisions to align security architecture with organisational objectives and regulatory requirements.

## 3. **Strategies**
   - **Purpose:** Strategies chart the course for achieving the cybersecurity objectives outlined in the principles. They encapsulate a high-level view of the tactical approaches, resource allocation, and long-term goals.
   - **Hierarchy:** Strategies are steered by the architectural principles and, in turn, guide the formulation of policies.

## 4. **Policies**
   - **Purpose:** Policies are the bedrock of the organizational cybersecurity stance, stipulating the mandatory protocols, behaviors, and actions that fortify the enterprise against threats.
   - **Hierarchy:** Policies are anchored to both principles and strategies, and they serve as the foundation for standards, procedures, and guidelines.
   - **Document list:**
     - **Cybersecurity Policy:** Outlines the company's stance, commitments, and approach towards cybersecurity.
     - **Acceptable Use Policy:** Provides guidelines for the acceptable use of company resources and networks.
     - **Remote Work Policy:** Guidelines for secure remote working practices.
     - **Mobile Device Management Policy:** Policies regarding the use of mobile devices within the corporate network.
     - **Password Policy:** Standards for password creation, management, and protection.
     - **Incident Response Policy:** Procedures for identifying, reporting, and managing cybersecurity incidents.
     - **Data Privacy Policy:** Management and protection of personal and sensitive data.

## 5. **Standards**
   - **Purpose:** Standards delve into the technical specifics, prescribing the particular technologies, configurations, and methodologies that are to be employed to adhere to the policies.
   - **Hierarchy:** Standards are a manifestation of policies in a more concrete and actionable form, and they lay the groundwork for procedures and guidelines.
   - **Document list:**
     - **Cybersecurity Standard:** A framework (such as NIST CSF) or standard (ISO 27001) based set of requirements and controls that help organisations to establish, implement, maintain and improve an information security management system. It is a systematic approach to managing the security of information assets, such as data, systems, networks, devices and people. It aims to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information from various threats and risks.
     - **Network Security Standard:** Configuring and managing network devices securely.
     - **Endpoint Security Standard:** Securing end-user devices like PCs and laptops.
     - **Application Security Standard:** Securing internal and external applications.
