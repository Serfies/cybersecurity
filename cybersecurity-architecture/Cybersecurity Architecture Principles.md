# Cybersecurity Architecture Principles

## Core Principles:
1. **Defense in Depth**:
   - Employ multiple layers of security measures to protect against threats.

2. **Least Privilege**:
   - Grant the minimal levels of access — or permissions — needed for users (and systems) to accomplish tasks.

3. **Zero Trust Architecture**:
   - Assume no trust and verify every process, user, and system to enhance security posture.

4. **Secure by Design**:
   - Incorporate security measures from the inception of system design.

5. **Privacy by Design**:
   - Integrate data privacy features within the architectural design.

6. **Incident Response Preparedness**:
   - Develop and maintain an incident response plan for cybersecurity incidents.

7. **Regular Patching and Updates**:
   - Ensure timely application of patches and updates to fix known vulnerabilities.

8. **Encryption**:
   - Protect data in transit and at rest through encryption.

9. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - Implement strong authentication and authorization controls.

10. **Monitoring and Auditing**:
    - Continuously monitor and audit systems for unusual activities.

11. **Cyber Hygiene and Awareness**:
    - Promote good cyber hygiene and security awareness among employees.

12. **Threat Intelligence**:
    - Utilize threat intelligence to stay ahead of emerging cybersecurity threats.

13. **Resilience**:
    - Design systems to withstand and recover from security incidents.

14. **Security Testing and Validation**:
    - Conduct regular security testing and validation to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.

15. **Supply Chain Security**:
    - Assess and manage the security risks associated with the supply chain.

16. **Legal and Regulatory Compliance**:
    - Ensure compliance with relevant legal, regulatory, and contractual obligations regarding cybersecurity.

17. **Security Governance**:
    - Establish a cybersecurity governance framework to support decision-making and ensure alignment with organizational objectives.

18. **Configuration Management**:
    - Establish robust configuration management processes to prevent unauthorized changes and misconfigurations.

19. **Data Governance and Classification**:
    - Implement data governance and classification to manage and protect data appropriately.

20. **Cloud Security**:
    - Adopt security best practices for cloud environments to protect data and services.

## Governance Principles:
1. **Cybersecurity Policy Framework**:
   - Develop and maintain a comprehensive cybersecurity policy framework.

2. **Cybersecurity Risk Management**:
   - Identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity risks in alignment with organizational risk tolerance.

3. **Third-Party Risk Management**:
   - Assess and manage risks associated with third-party vendors and service providers.

4. **Cybersecurity Training and Awareness**:
   - Implement ongoing training and awareness programs to keep staff informed on cybersecurity best practices and threats.

5. **Cybersecurity Metrics and Reporting**:
   - Establish metrics and reporting mechanisms to measure and communicate cybersecurity posture and performance.

6. **Cybersecurity Innovation**:
   - Encourage innovation to stay ahead of evolving cybersecurity threats and to continuously improve the cybersecurity posture.

7. **Stakeholder Communication**:
   - Establish clear channels of communication with stakeholders regarding cybersecurity policies, incidents, and initiatives.
