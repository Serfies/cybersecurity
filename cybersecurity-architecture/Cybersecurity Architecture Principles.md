# Cybersecurity Architecture Principles

A critical strategic tool that defines the overarching approach to securing an organisation's digital infrastructure, data, and operations. It lays the groundwork for building and maintaining a robust, resilient, and adaptable cybersecurity posture.

## Core Principles
   - Employ multiple layers of security measures to protect against threats.
   - Grant the minimal levels of access — or permissions — needed for users (and systems) to accomplish tasks.
   - Assume no trust and verify every process, user, and system to enhance security posture.
   - Incorporate security measures from the inception of system design.
   - Integrate data privacy features within the architectural design.
   - Develop and maintain an incident response plan for cybersecurity incidents.
   - Ensure timely application of patches and updates to fix known vulnerabilities.
   - Protect data in transit and at rest through encryption.
   - Implement strong authentication and authorisation controls.
   - Continuously monitor and audit systems for unusual activities.
   - Promote good cyber hygiene and security awareness among employees.
   - Utilise threat intelligence to stay ahead of emerging cybersecurity threats.
   - Design systems to withstand and recover from security incidents.
   - Conduct regular security testing and validation to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
   - Assess and manage the security risks associated with the supply chain.
   - Ensure compliance with relevant legal, regulatory, and contractual obligations regarding cybersecurity.
   - Establish robust configuration management processes to prevent unauthorised changes and misconfigurations.
   - Implement data governance and classification to manage and protect data appropriately.   
   - Adopt security best practices for cloud environments to protect data and services.

## Governance Principles
   - Establish a cybersecurity governance framework to support decision-making and ensure alignment with organisational objectives.
   - Develop and maintain a comprehensive cybersecurity policy framework.
   - Identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity risks in alignment with organisational risk tolerance.
   - Assess and manage risks associated with third-party vendors and service providers.
   - Implement ongoing training and awareness programs to keep staff informed on cybersecurity best practices and threats.
   - Establish metrics and reporting mechanisms to measure and communicate cybersecurity posture and performance.
   - Encourage innovation to stay ahead of evolving cybersecurity threats and to continuously improve the cybersecurity posture.
   - Establish clear channels of communication with stakeholders regarding cybersecurity policies, incidents, and initiatives.
